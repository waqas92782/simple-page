                        Faith S. And Her Husband</h2>
                    <p>Nerve Relief was discovered by Faith, a grandmother who suffered from neuropathy for years. After
                        countless sleepless nights, she found this magnesium-based formula that finally gave her relief
                        from burning pain. Now she's sharing her discovery with others.</p>

                            touch the floor, there's no stabbing pain. The burning that controlled your nights has

            <h3>From a Midnight Cry
                To 
                <span class="remove"><br></span>a Miracle For Thousands
            </h3>
            <p>
                Faith sat awake at 3 AM, another night when burning nerve pain had stolen her sleep. Neuropathy had
                taken her life piece by pieceâ€”her sleep, her independence, and time with grandchildren.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="remove"><br></span>
                After failed prescriptions and temporary creams, Faith discovered a special magnesium formula. The first
                application brought cooling relief. By the third night, she slept for six hours uninterrupted.
                <br><br>
                <span class="remove"><br></span>
                "I woke up crying," Faith remembers. "Not from pain, but because I'd forgotten what it felt like to
                exist without my nerves screaming."
                <br><br>
               <span class="remove"><br></span>
                Within weeks, Faith was playing with her grandchildren again. Friends began asking for her "secret," and
                she started sharing with her support group.
                Today, Nerve Relief has helped thousands reclaim their lives from neuropathy pain.
